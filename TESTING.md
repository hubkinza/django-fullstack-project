## CSS Validation 
CSS validation was completed using [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
There were no errors. The validator however did show some warnings but most were related to variables "Due to their dynamic nature, CSS variables are currently not statically checked
"

## Python Validation 
**[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com)** was used to validate the python code 

Only files where i wrote my own code were validated. Python code which was part of thje Django installation package did not need validation.
